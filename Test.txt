Core Requirements (“must”) 

 

·     Use the following API to extract the data and display it 

.     How you choose to display the data is up to you – think about what the user might want 

·     Produce a tool, or some tooling to infer common trends (e.g., Highest Costs) 

 

Extended Requirements (“should” / “could”) 

 

·     Make an easy-to-use, interactive, solution where a user can click on data to view further information 

.     At Elanco, we would typically make a web application to handle this – but you can decide how this would be best designed 

.     Go as simple or as complex as you would like – build with the user in mind!
